        Why is ‘const’ not implemented in Java?
Why make ‘const’ a reserved word if there was no intention of implementing it?

One possible reason is to just avoid confusion. If ‘const’ wasn’t a reserved word,
 developers would be allowed to use the phrase to name variables.
  Just imagine how much confusion that might cause for C++ and JavaScript developers who learned to
   program with languages where ‘const’ has an implementation.
    Simply making the ‘const’ keyword in Java a reserved word helps avoid any confusion.

Why is ‘const’ in Java a reserved word without an implementation?

Again, it’s largely to avoid confusion. Other keywords provide equivalent functionality, and because the concept doesn’t fit well in an object-oriented paradigm. Or to put it in layman’s terms, Java doesn’t need it.

For the most part, because the JDK doesn’t need it, ‘const’ has no implementation in Java.
Other language features provide the ability to declare constants or provide immutability.
The purveyors of the language wanted to avoid confusion and decided that not even well-meaning developers could use the term in their code.*/
